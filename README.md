# Senior-Design
Hey here's the github for our senior design.

The Synthetic folder is the work we've been doing after coronavirus hit.
Pictures folder contains the photos and maps we've been working on including code to get colors from sonar depth values
Pathfinding was our prototyping work we did to demonstrate our idea.
